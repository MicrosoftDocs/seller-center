# Merchant FAQ

Here are answers to frequently asked questions about merchant accounts and Seller Center.


## How do I connect payments to my business?

Go to [Seller Center](https://seller.microsoft.com) and select the **Register your merchant account** link for the program of your choice. (Note: You don’t need to register to sell through Microsoft Edge. To sell through Microsoft Bookings, go to [Bookings](https://office.com/bookings).) Enter your registration info and accept the Terms of Service. Follow the prompts to connect a new or existing merchant account to a payment service provider. 

You may be required to provide the following information for Seller Center registration: 
* Business name 
* Business address  
* Contact information 
* Business website address 

If you need to create a merchant account with a payment service provider, you may be required to provide the following information to acquire a merchant account: 
* Personal information 
* Business information 
* Valid United States bank account details 
* Tax identity information 


## How do I manage my Seller Center information?

Go to [Seller Center](https://seller.microsoft.com) and select **Dashboard** (in the upper-right corner of the page). On the dashboard, you can: 

* Check the status of your Seller Center registration
* Check the status of the connection of your merchant account to Microsoft
* If available, access a link to your payment service provider where you can view activity information, initiate a refund, dispute a chargeback, and inquire about your payout.

If you have question about your merchant account, its terms, or activity, please contact your payment service provider.  



## How do I disconnect my merchant account with Seller Center?

To disconnect your merchant account, go to [Seller Center](https://seller.microsoft.com) and select **Dashboard** (in the upper-right corner of the page). On the **Account details** page, select the **Disconnect merchant** link.

You can also disconnect your merchant account by going to your payment service provider’s website (Note: This is not applicable to WePay merchant accounts).



## What countries are supported?

Currently, only individuals or entities in the United States can register with Seller Center.


## What if I already have an account with Dev Center? 

You will still be required to verify or complete information in the Seller Center registration form and accept the Seller Center Terms of Service. You will only be able to connect or create a merchant account through Seller Center. If you need to view the programs you are affiliated with, go to [Seller Center](https://seller.microsoft.com) and select **Dashboard** (in the upper-right corner of the page).
